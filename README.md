Repository for the APEX quick look script

The GILDAS/CLASS macros displayes the spectra and calibraiton (Trec) for a given scan.

Note that to make it work on your own computer you need to create a few class symbols, or alternatively add an @ before calling the macros (add the minor edits inside the macros).

## Example run at APEX
```bash
LAS> ql 81026 81025
```
